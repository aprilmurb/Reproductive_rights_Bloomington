## Folkloric Stories of Self-Induced Abortion Methods

This collection includes selected documents from the [IU Archives' Indiana University Folklore Institute student papers, 1967-2000](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAD7971) collection. This collection includes an IU student's ethnographic research on folkloric self-induced abortion methods, in a study titled "Some Methods of Abortion in Oral Tradition." This study, conducted in 1968 (i.e., before abortion was nationally legalized in the United States), provides a fascinating glimpse into how women sought to manage unwanted pregnancies when safe medical care was unavailable or unaccessible. The self-induced methods, which many of the interviewees reported hearing from friends or acquaintances, include sustained physical exertion, insertion of sharp objects, and ingesting various substances. These interviews suggest that reproductive autonomy have always been a concern for women, and that vulnerable women may seek dangerous methods when legal medicare is not available.

The seven documents from this folklore collection comprise a small sample of the "Some Methods of Abortion in Oral Tradition" research paper, but have been selected to repesent the variety of reported methods in this collection. The research paper includes dozens of interviews that have not yet been digitized. By digitizing and sharing a selection of materials in this collection, it is hoped that interested researchers will find these materials useful and perhaps seek out other interviews from "Some Methods of Abortion in Oral Tradition" at the IU Archives.
