## Folkloric Stories of Self-Induced Abortion Methods

This collection includes selected documents from the [IU Archives' Indiana University Folklore Institute student papers, 1967-2000](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAD7971) collection. This collection includes an IU student's ethnographic research on folkloric self-induced abortion methods, in a study titled "Some Methods of Abortion in Oral Tradition." This study, conducted in 1968 (i.e., before abortion was nationally legalized in the United States), provides a fascinating glimpse into how women sought to manage unwanted pregnancies when safe medical care was unavailable or inaccessible. The self-induced methods, which many of the interviewees reported hearing from friends or acquaintances, include sustained physical exertion, insertion of sharp objects, and ingesting various substances. These interviews suggest that reproductive autonomy has always been a concern for women, and that vulnerable women may seek dangerous methods when medical care is not legal or available.

The seven documents from this folklore collection comprise a small sample of the "Some Methods of Abortion in Oral Tradition" research paper, but have been selected to repesent the variety of reported methods in this collection. The research paper includes dozens of interviews that have not yet been digitized. By digitizing and sharing a selection of materials from this collection, it is hoped that interested researchers will find these materials useful and perhaps seek out more interviews from "Some Methods of Abortion in Oral Tradition" at the IU Archives.

At the request of the Archives, the personally identifying information of the student researcher and of interviewees have been redacted from these documents. Please contact the [IU Archives](https://libraries.indiana.edu/university-archives) for more information about this collection.
