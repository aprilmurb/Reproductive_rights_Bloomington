## About the Collection

This digital collection of archival materials representing the history of abortion rights, activism, and access at Indiana University, Bloomington, is motivated by the June 2022 [*Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/) Supreme Court decision. This decision overturned *Roe v. Wade*, which guaranteed a federal right to abortion access in the United States. Since then, numerous states have restricted abortion rights for women and pregnant people, including Indiana, which passed a [law banning nearly all abortions in September 2022](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/14/1122835073/indiana-abortion-ban-thursday-roe-dobbs). In response to these recent events and their harmful effects, this collection showcases historical and cultural materials documenting abortion access for women in southern Indiana, including activist efforts, the history of illegal abortions prior to *Roe*, and conversations about abortion immediately after *Roe*. This collection shows the importance of guaranteeing abortion access for all who need it. 

April Urban, the organizer of the collection, has a PhD in English literature, theory, and cultural studies, and she is taking a cultural studies approach: the materials are cultural artifacts of a specific issue, place, and time. The archival materials are taken from the Indiana University Archives and cover the mid twentieth century (circa 1960s-1970s), both before and after the Roe decision. These materials include local newspaper articles, newsletters from the 1970s Bloomington Women’s Liberation organization, Planned Parenthood brochures, academic research (including an ethnographic study on folkloric stories of self-induced abortions), and an oral history. These materials represent the cultural and historical dimensions of abortion access in public, personal, and academic contexts.
