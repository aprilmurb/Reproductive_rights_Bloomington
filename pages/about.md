## About the Collection

This digital collection of archival materials representing the history of abortion rights, activism, and access at Indiana University, Bloomington, is motivated by the June 2022 [*Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization*](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/) Supreme Court decision. This decision overturned *Roe v. Wade*, which guaranteed a federal right to abortion access in the United States. Since then, numerous states have restricted abortion rights for women and pregnant people, including Indiana, which passed a [law banning nearly all abortions in September 2022](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/14/1122835073/indiana-abortion-ban-thursday-roe-dobbs). In response to these recent events and their harmful effects, this collection showcases historical and cultural materials documenting abortion access for women in southern Indiana, including activist efforts, the history of illegal abortions prior to *Roe*, and conversations about abortion immediately after *Roe*. This collection shows the importance of guaranteeing abortion access for all who need it. 

April Urban, the organizer of the collection, has a PhD in English literature, theory, and cultural studies, and she is taking a cultural studies approach: the materials are cultural artifacts of a specific issue, place, and time. The archival materials are taken from the [Indiana University Archives](https://libraries.indiana.edu/university-archives) and cover the mid twentieth century (circa 1960s-1970s), both before and after the *Roe* decision. These materials represent the cultural and historical dimensions of abortion access in public, personal, and academic contexts. All text documents are PDFs that have undergone Optical Character Recognition (OCR), meaning that their text is searchable. April digitized (scanned and OCRed) all text documents except for those from the [Martha Vicinus](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAA2607) and [Leo Varjian](https://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAD9380) collections, which were digitized by the IU Archives, and the [oral history with Nancy Brand and Ruth Mahaney](https://aprilmurb.github.io/Reproductive_rights_Bloomington/item.html?id=Oral_history_Brand_Mahaney_2013_a), the audio and transcript of which were made available by the IU Archives.
